Client/Server Development
###	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, I follow consistent naming conventions, use modular design, and include inline comments where necessary. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, this structure allowed me to easily connect it to the dashboard in Project Two without rewriting code. The benefit of working this way is that the same module can be reused in future applications or extended to support new features, such as user authentication or data validation.
###	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and breaking them into smaller parts, such as separating database logic, data filtering, and UI rendering. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I designed MongoDB queries based on the clientâ€™s filtering needs and built the dashboard in layers. Compared to earlier coursework, this project placed more emphasis on user experience and real-time interaction; therefore, in future projects, I would focus on designing flexible queries and callback logic early in development.
###	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing systems that process, store, and display information efficiently. My work on this project helped Grazioso Salvare quickly identify animals suitable for rescue training, saving staff time and enhancing the adoption process. Examples like this demonstrate how software can assist mission-driven organizations by turning raw data into practical insights.
